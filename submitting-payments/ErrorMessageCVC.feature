    Feature: Error message for the invalid CVC number
    
        As a customer, I want to be informed when the CVC number I enter is incorrect or too short.

        # Jira AC:

        #   1. The Immediate error message should be thrown if the CVC number is too short. "Your card's security code is incomplete."
