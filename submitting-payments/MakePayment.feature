    Feature: Make a payment
    
        As a customer, I should be able to make payments so I can enroll in the program.

    #Jira AC:

    #   1. When the user enters valid card information, checks the terms and conditions checkbox, and clicks on the Pay button, then they should be redirected to the confirmation page.
    #   2. In the stepper, steps 1, 2, 3 should be green.
    #   3. The correct program name should be displayed.
    #   4. The correct user email should be displayed.
    #   5. The correct company contact information should be displayed.
