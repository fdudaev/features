Feature: Selecting a payment plan

    As a customer, I want to be able to Choose a payment plan from the available options 
        so that I can choose the one that best suits my needs.

        # Jira AC:
        #   1. When usr is navigated to payment plan page for the first, by default no payment is selcted and the next button is disabled
        #   2. When the user selects any payment plan (Accordion) that option should be highlighted to indicate selection.
        #   3. Upon selecting any pricing option, the 'Next' button should become active (indicating the user can proceed).
        #   4. Users should be able to change their plan selections at any time before finalizing their choice.
