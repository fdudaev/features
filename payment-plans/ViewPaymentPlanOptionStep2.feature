Feature: View payment plan options in Step 2

    As a customer, I should be able to see payment plan options in Step 2.

    #Jira AC:

    #   1. Upfront payment: 
    #       1.1 There should be only one upfront price
    #       1.2 Text should be Upfront  (first row) and $ <upfont_price> pay once (second row)
    #   2. Installment plans:
    #       2.1 There must be total <num> Payment Plans
    #       2.2 There can be <number_of_installments> installments
    #       2.3  If there are installments, then the text should be <number_of_installments> Installments (first row) and $ <monthly_price> per month (second row)
    #       2.4 Installment plans should be unique
